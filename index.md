I am motivated by collecting. But I've worked hard to avoid simply accumulation. This blog is my attempt at curation. Organization. Fascination.

The most boring origin story of all time: I read a lot as a kid. Then I stopped. Goodreads motivated me to start reading again, but I am hoping that I might disengage from the that platform and start a minimalistic but effective repository for my media diet.
